## Security Unlocked

**Security Unlocked** is a clean, no-drama home for my writing and speaking—focused on cybersecurity, AI, risk, and the places where technology, markets, and policy intersect. I use this site to publish original essays and to catalog third-party pieces I’ve written elsewhere so everything lives in one place.

### What I Cover
- Security architecture, incident response, and modern SOC tradecraft  
- AI in security: model risks, guardrails, detection/response augmentation  
- Cloud & identity: zero trust, access patterns, attack paths  
- Software & data risk: supply chain, memory safety, privacy by design  
- Geopolitics for practitioners when it materially impacts security decisions

### Who This Is For
- Security leaders and engineers who like crisp, practical writing  
- Builders and investors thinking rigorously about risk and leverage  
- Curious generalists who want clarity without jargon

### How I Work
I prefer clear thesis → evidence → counterpoints → takeaways. I publish drafts, refine, and when necessary link to deeper appendices, data, or code.
